Courses and projects done in Codecademy. Some of the code is not mine, most of it are exercises. There are three small projects inside the Computer Science path folder.

Laboratory, Numerical analysis with C++, Scientific computing with Python

Modules taken at university. The laboratory files were useful in analysing laboratory data, the C++ files are mostly code we were given to learn different methods and exam preparation practice and the files in Python are lecture exercises and coursework.
